# Price and Rating Analysis for Hotels in iran

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to collect data about hotels in iran through web scraping then perform analyses based on the acquired information,enabling us to gain valuable insights into consumer trends and preferences across different geographical locations.

## Data Source
The dataset is gathered by web scraping from "https://iran.1stquest.com/hotel". This website is for hotel reservations, encompassing the price and rating of hotels in different cities. This information is extracted for several major tourist cities and collected in a DataFrame.


## Hypothesis
Hypothesis 1- Price impact: Most expensive hotels are located in specific cities.

Hypothesis 2- Location impact: Hotels in certain locations might have highter rating compared to others due to factors like proximity to tourist attractions or amenities.

Hypothesis 3- Price vs. Rating by location: 
Analyzing price ranges within different locations could reveal trends, such as budget hotels in one area having similar ratings to mid-range hotels in another.

## Findings and suggestion
Most expensive hotels are located in Kish island which is famous for beaches and water sports and then in Tehran which is the capital city.
Future Considerations: Investigate if the result is the same during other seasons.

4 stars Hotels in ancient cities have higher price than the 5 stars maybe because tourists prefer to stay in traditional hotels which are rating 4 stars.
Future Considerations: Relationship between location of the hotel and tourist attraction areas distance impact the price and rate of the hotels.
